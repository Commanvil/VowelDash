# VowelDash

## What is VowelDash?
VowelDash is a text encryption that I made for both testing and learning purposes

## How does it work?
Good question.

Simply put a <Vowel> as the head and <Symbols> on the back
The symbols (in order) are **-+='/:** (but for letters "A" and "E", they only have "-+='")
  
(For the dashes "-", they're a little bit confusing..)

## Examples plez
```
Readable text >> VowelDash
A >> A (obviously)
A+ >> B
A+-' >> BAD
A- >> Imperfect (When you just want 'A', but it doesn't have any other symbols beside it, don't type the "-")
A-- >> AA (Don't get confused! The number of symbols are going to be the number of letters, so 2 dashes mean 2 letter "A"s)
A/ >> INCORRECT
**If you want to type "E" or "F", instead type:**
E >> E
E+ >> F
This is because vowel A is not allowed to surpass vowel E
